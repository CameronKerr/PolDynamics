# Coupled opinion-environmnetal dynamics in polarized and prejudiced populations

# Abstract

We developed a coupled opinion-environmental model to investigate how social, cognitive, and experiential factors shape opinion formation in polarized populations. Motivated by empirical stud- ies, individuals in the model were influenced by social interactions, personal prejudice, and en- vironmental feedback. Using analytical and numerical methods, we characterized the conditions under which polarization, consensus, opinion changes, and cyclic dynamics emerge depending on the costs of mitigation, environmental damage, and the factors influencing opinion formation. Our model shows that prejudice is the key driver of persistent polarization, with even slightly preju- diced populations maintaining indefinite polarization independent of their level of objectivity. We predict that polarization can be reduced through decreasing the role of prejudice or increasing tol- erance towards the opposing groups opinions. Finally, our model shows that lowering the cost of mitigation is less effective at reducing environmental impact in prejudiced and polarized popula- tions. Furthermore, our model predicts thresholds for when reducing costs or emissions is more useful depending on the factors which influence the populationâ€™s opinion formation. Overall, our model provides a framework for investigating the importance of cognitive and social structures in determining opinion-environmental dynamics.
